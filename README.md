# Code Breakdown:

HTML: Defines the basic structure of the webpage and includes a div element with the id "toogle" that acts as the toggle button.
CSS: Styles the webpage elements, including:
Setting the initial background color to dark gray.
Defining styles for the toggle button and its indicator element.
Applying transitions for smooth animation of the background color and indicator position.
JavaScript: Attaches a click event listener to the toggle button. When clicked, the script toggles the "active" class on both the body and the toggle element, which triggers the background color change and indicator animation based on the CSS styles.
